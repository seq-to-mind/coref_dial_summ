{ Clara | Neela }  # Clara: Hi, what you up to? # Neela: Not much, chilling out. # Clara: Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!😍 # Neela: Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good? # Clara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence. # Neela: Why is it called Dear White People? # Clara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio. # Neela: Yeah, but why is it so good? # Clara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too. # Neela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then? # Clara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand. # Neela: How's that? # Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that. # Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens? # Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies. # Neela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon! # Clara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it! # Neela: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People. # Clara: Don't blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4! # Neela: See ya, love! # Clara: Bye!

I don't what to tell you # Adam: I was wondering how I can help her # Karen: Honestly I don't know if we can help her, Adam. I suggested a specialist because these are very sensitive issues and I'm afraid we may unintentionally make it worse # Adam: Yes, but she doesn't want to see a specialist. Basically, she doesn't want to see anyone # Karen: Hm... I don't know... How about I call someone for advice? So we could know what to do # Adam: Sounds rational, do you know anyone you could call? Don't mention her name # Karen: Of course I won't! I have a friend who's a psychologist, we can trust her. I'll let you know # Adam: Thank you Karen!

How dare he?!!! # Jen: I've learnt to hate him with a passion. He's like vermin that you can't cull. # Jen: Abusive, nasty, annoying, irresponsible. He disgusts me. # Jane: Get rid of him!

I'm afraid of asking him to leave 'cause it will only cause another fight. # Jane: You can't spend your whole life walking on eggshells. # Jen: Yeah, you're right... but how do I get out of this mess? # Jane: I think you've got to cut your losses and just move on. # Jen: Easier said than done. # Jane: I know. You've gotta do it Hon. If you don't things will only get worse. Think of how much worse they've already got since you met him. # Jen: Yeah you're right. Sometimes I just don't have the strength.  # Jane: I believe in you. Please do it! Remember I'm always there for you.

{ Andrew | Bez }  # Andrew: Hello Bez, this morning I wanted to take your car and go to Krizingen but it showed "low  brake fluid level". So I went only to the garage next to Willig and they said it's ok, probably a display error. Do you want me to have the car checked properly? Have you got a contract with some garage in particular? # Andrew: Kate took your car today, just to check, and everything was fine. It must have been in fact display error. # Andrew: Hi Bez, when are you back? What date? # Bez: Hello Andy and Kate! Sorry for not replying immediately. We have here no wifi internet connection. I'm in a hotel lobby now and use a "phone credit". # Bez: The car should be ok as it passed general inspection only in June. I usually go to a garage in Crinch. But don't bother as long it shows no more alarms. # Bez: Apart from that is everything alright? Automatic lights going on and off? One downstairs, one upstairs. # Bez: Please don't forget to give the plants in the basement an occasional drink! Thank you. # Bez: I'm home on the 21st in the evening. Could you please switch the heating on a bit on that day? # Andrew: Hello Bez, just as we thought. No internet. Everything is fine here, also the car. The plants in the basement are watered once a week but not too much. # Andrew: <file_photo> Your natal lily has just started to flower. # Andrew: and look at this: # Andrew: <file_photo> # Andrew: Greetings from your frost-bound garden! # Bez: Thank you Andy!

{ Nancy | Vic | Phil }  # Nancy: Yeah, but u can also read the news online ;) # Phil: I know, but imagine - ur keen on technology and u get all the news in one place. Then u can choose what to read and what not. # Nancy: Sounds sensible. Does it have something 4 fashion? # Phil: Probably so. Not sure, though. # Nancy: How about u, Vic? # Vic: I still prefer Facebook. Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook. # Phil: Well, it's intended in a completely different way.  # Vic: What do u mean? # Phil: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u. # Vic: Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters. # Phil: 280. Still, a downside. OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook. # Nancy: So no one uses 4 example Instagram? # Vic: I do.  # Phil: Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online.  # Nancy: But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering. There are also companies on Instagram. # Phil: I know, but I'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast.  # Vic: That's not all ppl post on Instagram! # Phil: So, what else? # Vic: Depends on ur interest. I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :) # Phil: And does this motivate u to train? # Vic: No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not.  # Nancy: What do u think about Tumblr? # Phil: What? # Vic: Heard about it, but never had an account. # Nancy: It's a microblogging website. U can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything u want there. And ppl can observe u! # Phil: Don't have that much time to write a blog. # Vic: Me neither.  # Phil: Nancy, y do u ask these questions? ;) # Nancy: I have my reasons ;)

So I take it ur satisfied? # Jake: I am, I rarely think about changing companies.  # Catherine: Does the company offer possibilities of personal development & promotion? # Catherine: I mean is there a clear career path? # Jake: Yup, that's the main pro of this place & the benefits. # Jake: I was promoted twice during these 5 yrs & the salary increase with each promotion is quite significant. # Catherine: That's good to hear. Most companies 2day are implementing cost saving policies & the employees are the ones who suffer. # Catherine: I mean at my current workplace u can only count on inflation salary increases. So u barely see the difference on ur paycheck. # Jake: That's what I hear from most of my friends. It's a tough time 4 employees on the market nowadays. # Jake: 4 now our company is still dynamically expanding.  # Catherine: And how about the benefits u mentioned? # Jake: The company partially finances language & accounting courses. # Jake: There's also a yearly bonus that depends on your achievements and private healthcare. # Catherine: That sounds like a dream :D Your HR dept. gave me a call yesterday and invited me to an interview on Monday. # Jake: That's great! I'll keep my fingers crossed :) # Catherine: Thanks Jake :) Is there anything I should prepare/review before the interview? # Jake: Well I think it would be beneficial to know some facts about the company. # Jake: You can find them on the official website, in the "about us" section:  <file_other>  # Catherine: OK, I'll definitely take a look. # Jake: And they may ask u some Qs about accounting principles, the basics. But I mean that won't be a problem 4 u. # Jake: I remember u graduated with honours from uni. # Catherine: That's true. :) I'm a bit nervous though. # Jake: There's no need to be. Give me a call after the interview. Good luck! # Catherine: Thanks. TTYS!

{ Ronnie | Clint }  # Clint: I'm curious. How's the waste management working out over there? # Ronnie: It actually works very well. We use three different bins: compost, recycle and trash. Compost anything organic from yard waste to food scraps. Recycle for paper, bottles, cardboard, plastic, metals. And trash everything else. Why do you ask? # Clint: Sheer curiosity. What about general awareness? Plastic bags, etc.? # Ronnie: Very high. No more single use plastic bags in grocery stores. No more straws in restaurants. # Clint: Yeah, I read yours was one of the cities that banned them. I wonder when that will get here. # Ronnie: Never... # Clint:: What do you mean? # Ronnie: I highly doubt that type of environmental awareness will happen there. People there live in a different world when it comes to that. # Clint: People don't have to have any awareness, tbh. It's above them. If there were such decisions made they would follow # Ronnie: That is true. But at the state government level I don't think there is that awareness either. But hopefully I am proven wrong! # Clint: Really bizarre. I noticed it's struggling here. On the other hand, it's money. # Ronnie: Money in the sense of? # Clint: Reducing waste=lower utilization costs. Do they sort through everything further down? # Ronnie: Yes here they do.  # Clint: It seems to be the same way here. Dry recyclables, food and general, compost

{ Sophie | Noah }  # Noah: Hi there! The quince we talked about the other day... Are you still interested? # Sophie: Hello Noah, but of course I am.Thank you. # Noah: Actually William went to collect the rest of them for you immediately. They're in a basket on our terrace, so you call collect them any time. # Sophie: That's very very kind of him! He's really a darling. # Sophie: We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall? # Noah: Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool. # Sophie: It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap. # Noah: OK. # Sophie: Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince? # Noah: Absolutely! In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. Of course it would be great to see your twins again. Haven't seen them for ages! # Sophie: Well we don't see that much of them either :( They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony. # Noah: Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much. # Sophie: I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have William at home all that often either, do you? # Noah: He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of "family care" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own. # Sophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment! # Noah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque. # Sophie: Oh dear! What could it mean? # Noah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings. # Sophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else. # Noah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him. # Sophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all. # Noah: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me. # Sophie: They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright? # Noah: Sure. Thank you Sophie for a nice chat! # Sophie: Thank you for the quince!

I'm not exactly Steven Spielberg. # Jake: I do, but I dont always have time to do much. # Olivia: If I put in any music I always get a copyright strike and someone else is taking the ad revenue # Jake: Yeah. And some of those claims are purely speculative. One time I put on one of my own pieces and it was challenged by Sony Music # Olivia: No way! # Jake: It's true. On the form you fill in to counter the claim I said if Sony want to make me one of their signed artists, that's fine. Otherwise to get they paws off of my music.

SORRY! # Linda: No worries babe! It's nothing. Really. # Emily: I'm feeling so bad about it. So clumsy of me. # Linda: Look. I never really liked the set, so one cup makes no difference.

The crockery there is more for decoration. # Emily: Exactly. I thought they're so pretty, especially the green ones, and then noticed how dusty they are.

You are a fantastic guest. # Emily: Ya. Smashing. As we say in GB. # Linda: You know what? Take out the whole green set. If you like it so much - it is yours. # Emily: But Linda!

It's my intention to rent it out and do the restitution of my money. # Vesna: Well doneeeee!. # Ost: There is a big crowd in parking, so the prices for finding garage places are favorable, in this area. # Vesna: Really!. # Ost: Return on investment is much higher than if I give money under term savings in the Bank. # Vesna: You make sense for money. # Ost: The interest rates are very small, almost close to zero, "only they do not ask you to pay them, for holding money in the Bank". # Vesna: O yes. # Ost: Prices of garage places, in Belgrade, will only grow. # Vesna: Really!. # Ost: Yes, there are more and more vehicles in the city center, as the number of vehicles per family is growing. It used to be about one vehicle per family, and now it's approaching an average of two vehicles. # Vesna: Yes.. # Ost: And there will not be new parking space.

{ Brett | Andrew | John }  # Brett: So what do u do there? Drive a tank all the time? # John: Yes and no. U've got players from around the world and they have their tank squadrons and u battle them. Can be a lot of fun! # Andrew: So what happens if someone is on a higher level than u? They basically destroy u! # John: That's not a problem. The game doesn't allow higher ranked players o interact with players out of their range. # Brett: What do u mean? # John: If ur on lvl 5, a player on lvl 30 can't attack u.  # Andrew: Sensible. Unlike WoW. # John: So what's WoW like? # Andrew: Imagine having a character u rly like and u give it a lot of ur attention and get experience point, level up and so on. Someone who's played the game for like a year comes and kills u instantly. # Brett: Not cool.  # John: Yeah. Y would they allow such a thing? # Andrew: Well, open world, u can team up with anyone, do quests together, arrange fighting tactics and so on. # Brett: Actually, my cousin met his wife there :) # John: Rly? # Brett: Yeah. They were playing together for some time, talking and at some point he invited her to a date. Turned out they lived very close to each other ;) # Andrew: That's gr8! And how are they getting along now? # Brett: Most fights are about who gets 2 play at a given moment ;)  # John: Lol # Andrew: Well my favourite genre is RPGs :) # John: Can u name a title, except WoW? # Andrew: I can name a dozen, but one of my personal faves is the Final Fantasy series :) # Brett: What's this one about? # Andrew: Don't tell me u haven't heard about the greatest RPG series of all times? # John: Well, I haven't. # Andrew: I think I'll have to look for new friends... So embarrassing. # Brett: C'mon! Tell us! # Andrew: Fine... Usually u play a group of friends that have to resolve some kind of crisis. In the last part u play a prince whose kingdom has been destroyed and u try to well get revenge. # Brett: Sounds boring.  # Andrew: Believe me, it's not!

I hate him. # Zach: You're gonna quit? # Rael: It's not that easy, I gotta find something. I don't want to leave without first finding a new job. # Zach: I see. Did you think about IT? # Rael: No, why? # Zach: Girl, it's the best place to work in! A lot of my friends started as software testers and they are really satisfied. Good money and no rat race. # Rael: Zach, are you crazy? I don't have technical studies. # Zach: You don't have to. If you have good analytical skills all you need is some online course - Udemy or something. People change their career after years of employment in totally different business. It's not that difficult, really. You should give it a try. Tech is our future. # Rael: Hmm... Maybe you're right. I'm still not sure what to do with my career, so... why not. # Zach: If you want, I can talk to my friends and they will give you some advice on how to start, what courses to choose and so on. # Rael: That would be great, thanks. # Zach: UW. In touch.

{ Kate | Chris | Mary }  # Kate: I just had a fight with Chris :/ # Mary: Oh no, not again # Kate: It's not me who started it. I don't know why he says certain stuff, it seems like he's doing it on purpose # Mary: What was it this time? # Kate: Same thing, as always. Really, he knows what I think and I know what he thinks so I don't bring up certain things. I don't want to argue, but if it keeps happening, I don't see the point of talking to him # Kate: I'm angry every single time I talk with him # Mary: Eh, I don't get why he keeps doing it. What did he say? # Kate: I don't want to get worked up over it again, but really usual stuff. He watched a programme about the refugees and went on a rant about it # Mary: oh god # Kate: right?! I don't know why I'm still talking with him. I tried to talk some sense into him, apparently with no luck # Mary: What did you tell him? # Kate: What I usually tell him. He was an immigrant once, he was working abroad, I sent him all the data and research, statistics, everything. # Mary: I'm afraid Chris may be too pig-headed for that # Kate: Pfff I bet he didn't even read anything. He's just watching the nationalists, Trump and all those idiots, listens to everything they're saying on the telly instead of just thinking for once # Mary: I know, to be honest I kind of avoid these subjects when I'm talking with him # Kate: Well, I try to as well, but as you can see he can't stop himself # Kate: I know he's our friend and we go out often, but I'm not sure I can do it any more, I don't want be friends with someone who thinks that Mexican children are worse and that they should be kept away from the US # Mary: Oh my god he said that? # Kate: Yes :/ # Mary: Jesus, I knew he has strong views, but to say something like that? That's a bit too much # Kate: You're telling me this. I think we should reconsider this let's say friendship, because if every conversation will lead to something like this, I'm not interested in staying in touch with him # Mary: No wonder

She never gives up so easily. # Ravi: She is still the same, however abiding by the doctor’s advice she prefers to stay at home most of the time. # Jaya: Please ask her to take care and start feeling better soon.  # Ravi: Thanks. I'll pass your wishes to her.

Go for it! # Kelly: What's the scariest place you've been to! # Jessica: I'll start: Palermo in Italy. # Mickey: And what's so scary about that? Did you break your nail? :P # Jessica: Shut it, Mickey! No, there are the Capuchin Catacombs with 8000 corpses!  # Kelly: Ewwww! Corpses? Rly? # Jessica: Yeah! And you can look at them like museum exhibits. I think they're divided somehow, but have no clue how! # Ollie: That's so cool! Do you get to see the bones or are they covered up? # Jessica: Well, partly. Most of them were exhibited in their clothes. Basically only skulls and hands.  # Mickey: I'm writing this one down! That's so precious! # Ollie: Me too!
{ Maria | Spencer }  # Maria: Hi Spence, life treating you well? # Spencer: Can't complain love, lots of commissions coming in and all that! # Maria: Getting your name out there! Saw some of your new stuff on Instagram, liked it! # Spencer: Yeah, thanks love! How's the call centre? # Maria: Same old, same old. Can't wait to go part time next year, really want to get on with some freelancing. # Spencer: Yeah, pity they won't allow it for a year. I'm on 16 fixed hours at the cafe which suits me great. I've then got the rest of the week to work on my illustrations. # Maria: How do you get new clients, Spence? I really need to pick your brains sometimes! # Spencer: Well, some of them saw my printing in the shops I sell to and contacted me directly, then there's the agency and my social media stuff. I probably get around £1000  of work a month now, before commission and tax. # Maria: Well that's just about liveable with the cafe wage, I imagine. # Spencer: Yes, it's tight, but I am very frugal. Still have a hefty chunk going out on rent and bills. # Maria: Hmm, I'll have to budget carefully when I do it. # Spencer: Yes, but it's well worth it. I LOVE the work so much! # Maria: Well, your passion is obvious! Your stuff is amazing! # Spencer: Well, so was yours in Uni. Don't let your talent go to waste! # Maria: You've inspired me, Spence. See you soon, hopefully! # Spencer: See ya!
{ Tim | Joe }  # Tim: Hey, you have a few minutes? # Joe: Sure, what's up? # Tim: I'm thinking about inviting a few people from work over and I kinda thought that maybe some boardgames would be a cool idea. # Tim: And I wanted to consult the expert on the matter :) # Joe: As you know I'm always happy to share my expertise with anyone willing to listen. You will just need to stop me when I get too wound up :D # Tim: Haha :) Ok, So I know you ran the local club - any tips how to organize a newbie gaming evening? And what games to bring? # Joe: yeah, sure - just a few general tips :) # Joe: Start games before you start drinking :) And don't bring any game that is either over-complicated, requires too much time to explain, or god forbid encourages direct conflict - you know, the plotting-scheming stuff. So no Game of Thrones :) # Joe: Or alternatively you can chose some cooperative games - like Arkham Horror, Robinson Crusoe, Pandemic # Tim: Got it :D  # Joe: Also would be great to know what theme they all like - if there is one. And if not then there are some 'vanilla' games - like Codenames or Catan. Any idea what they might be into?  # Tim: Not really - there are some guys who I know like sci-fi and comic books, but no idea about the girls...  # Joe: The best way - just talk with them - might be surprised by their tastes and experiences. Maybe some of them are already into gaming? There are nerds in every walk of life :) # Tim: Yeah, I know, all too well :) # Tim: Anyway, thanks for the tips - co-op games sound like a good idea for a start. # Joe: yeah, and then if the idea sticks you can roll out the big guns :) # Tim: Will do that :)

{ Simon | Charlie }  # Simon: <file_photo> # Simon: It's funny and scary at the same time. # Simon: BTW it's so annoying that people can't see that such immigration policy reduces safety level for citizens of EU significantly # Charlie: This photo is great. It totally shows what do we all mean when we criticize EU policy.  # Charlie: Berlin has put concrete blocks around Christmas fair, Belgium has soldiers running armed around cities and Paris has mass demonstrations and car arsons happening all over the city. # Charlie: Poland though... # Charlie: One of the last countries unspoilt by uncontrolled migration and terrorism # Charlie: The question is - for how long... # Simon: I always say that there is advantage of the polish situation # Simon: I mean being economically delayed for few decades # Simon: Poland has a chance to develop in fast pace and at the same time has a position to avoid all the mistakes other western powers made. # Simon: The worst thing is that the country is being ostracized by defending it's values and interests.  # Charlie: Yup. And as long as there are people in Poland ready to defend that values, the country will be marginalized by every other nation. # Simon: I admire Poles. # Simon: I admire them for they will to fight. # Simon: They never give up. # Charlie: Different countries tried to eliminate them from the map. # Simon: I tell you, there will be time, when only Poland will have power to fight with internal problems of Europe. # Charlie: Maybe. But there is a risk that internal conflict will rip the country apart. # Simon: Let's hope not. # Charlie: Yup. To conclude: Christmas in Poland will be the best Christmas in Europe :D # Simon: I agree :)

At the weekend I suppose? # Gloria: Let me check the calendar. Here's our family planner. A horrible name, isn't it? So this weekend suits us fine. At the next one, on Saturday, Mark has penciled something in but I can't read it. So what about this Saturday? # Mell: Perfect. At least we know the weather holds. Shall I do the food and you the drinks? # Gloria: And I'll get us some dessert as well.  # Mell: Very good indeed. It's always so easy going with you. # Gloria: Ta! You were thinking about Tad's sister? # Mell: I'm afraid so. I'm so happy she moved up to Scotland and I don't have to put up with her trying to run my household.

{ Betty | Andy }  # Andy: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room. # Betty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts?  # Andy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows. # Betty: Why is that? # Andy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow. # Betty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms? # Andy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls. # Betty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones? # Andy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen. # Betty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then? # Andy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.   # Betty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation? # Andy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.   # Betty: So what would you recommend? # Andy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night.  # Betty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient?  # Andy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself. # Betty: OK, is this something your company can help with? # Andy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want.  # Betty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email? # Andy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday.  # Betty: That would be great. And again, thanks for today! # Andy: No problem, speak soon.

{ Sean | Rick | John }  # Sean: Friendly reminder of trade deadline today. Let's get those last minute trade request sent. # Rick: So does John get Lamar Jackson or is he scrambling for another qb?? # Sean: Nick needs to really think about rolling with Blake. John needs a QB! # John: I think I would have rights to Lamar but I think the consensus is that he's on waivers so he's open. I guess I'm just hoping RGIII and Brock play or just wait... # Rick: Crazy it happens though! he one thing in the chart that isn't addressed. We could vote and go from there. I just want you to lose a player and Nick not to get Lamar. # John: In 15 years I've never seen a ream trade a big time RB or WR  for a QB this late n the season do anything in the playoffs. That ends their season. Of course a one QB team isn't worth anything either. I have t take my chances. # Sean: Damned if you do, damned if you don't. # Rick: people's evidence  658 why the QB rule doesn't work. # John: I might have a way to drop the rule completely next year. # Sean: I guess we will have to talk about after the season. # Rick: Nobody liked my IR suggestion a couple of years ago. That solves a large percentage of the issue tho # Sean: 1 QB not 2 for a 14 league... # John: as I said, we can look at if after the season. I just wouldn't want to make it any easier. What has made the league so great its that it has been really difficult so far.

I was thinking of going this weekend with Lane, but I've seen some bad reviews. # Carrie: Depends on what you expect really - I have a lot of sentiment towards Harry Potter so, I'm gonna like everything the do. But seriously the movie was decent. However, if you're expecting to have your mind blown, then no, it's not THAT good. # Gina: I agree. I saw it last week and basically I'm satisfied. # Alex: No spoilers, girls. # Carrie: no worries ;) # Carrie: And Gina, what do you think about Eddie Redmayne as Newt? # Gina: I loved him <3 I loved how introverted and awkward he was and how caring he was towards the animals. And with all that he showed a lot of confidence in his beliefs and was a genuinely compassionate character # Carrie: not your standard protagonist, that's for sure # Gina: and that's what I liked about him # Alex: Maybe I'll go and see it sooner so we can all talk about it. # Carrie: go see it.

I know it’s not smart to quit without an alternative # Kai: depends on the field. I don't know yours and your experience. But it can be a bit stressful also # Michael: true, in my field it wouldn’t be good. Anyway I need to speak to my manager and discuss because I’m not happy in my job now. How’s everything on your side? too much work? # Kai: yes, I basically never rest these days # Michael: that’s not good, you need rest to avoid a burnout, which I had just before I went on holiday # Kai: Probably, I have a conference 8th of Dec, then I'll rest a bit, I hope.

{ Josie | Eco | Stefano | Salman Rushdie }  # Stefano: Hi, Josie! # Josie: Ciao, Stefano! # Stefano: So, what about Foucault's Pendulum? Do you like it? # Josie: It's... weird. Was it really written by an Italian guy? It's so... nerdy. # Stefano: Oh well, in a sense Eco was the king of nerds. And, you know, not all Italian books are about pizza, mafia and mandolino. :P # Josie: Yes, I know... I should try and read one of his novels in the original, but I'm not sure my level of Italian is adequate. # Stefano: The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know. # Josie: And what about Foucault's Pendulum? # Stefano: Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel. # Josie: Btw, I read Salman Rushdie's review of Pendulum, published in the 80s. # Stefano: Really? What did he say? # Josie: He hated it and said that it's not a novel, but rather a computer game. # Stefano: What? Rotfl! # Josie: That's what Salman said... # Stefano: Oh well, de gustipus non est disputandum... # Josie: De gustiBus! # Stefano: I know, it was a typo! # Josie: Disgusting pus! # Stefano: Hahaha. # Josie: Yuk! That's so creepy. # Stefano: You're the one who said it! # Josie: I know. ;)

{ Bobby }  # Bobby: U know what annoys me the most? # Mickey: Not being able to watch TV or listen to music without pesky interruptions? # Bobby: That too, but the thing that annoys me the most is pharmaceuticals, medicine and drugs. # Mickey: Y? Aren't they good 4 ur health? # Bobby: They may well be, but not for my wallet! # Mickey: What do u mean? # Bobby: I was watching a film last night and suddenly there's a bunch of commercial of different medical products and so on. # Mickey: And what of it? # Bobby: Imagine that pharmaceutical companies invent illnesses! # Mickey: What? Are u sure? # Bobby: No, I'm not, but in the commercial they mentioned a name of an illness I have never heard of. # Mickey: So what? There are many illnesses and diseases I've never heard of.  # Bobby: So I did some research. Turns out such a thing does not exist. No medical journal writes about it, no medical forum suggests caution. # Mickey: That doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  # Bobby: I even found a youtube video of a doctor explaining y it's not an illness.  # Mickey: All right, this is quite serious. # Bobby: So I put my mind to it and do u know what I came up with? # Mickey: What? # Bobby: That in this particular case they're selling mints as medical products! # Mickey: Srsly?! # Bobby: Absolutely! # Mickey: How long do u think they've been lying to us? # Bobby: Can't be sure, but probably 4ever. Imagine every illness, disease and so on. Where do these come from? Why do they spread so fast? # Mickey: That is kinda puzzling. # Bobby: Right? # Mickey: So why is no one doing anything about it? # Bobby: Do u know how much the pharmaceutical industry is worth today? # Mickey: No. # Bobby: At least $1.2 bln! # Mickey: Explains a lot.

I was just joking. It was such a surreal dream that I had to share it with you ;) # Lynn: Well... # Jess: Do you believe in dreams, Lynn? # Lynn: I'm not saying I believe, but I think that sometimes it is possible that our dreams are telling us something. Not like they can show us our future or anything like that, it's just that dreams reflect our subconsciousness, don't you think? # Jess: I guess?  # Charlie: I've read somewhere that when we see strangers in our dreams, in fact we must have seen them somewhere before. Our brain is not able to create such images on its own, it must have registered some random people's faces, and it uses them when we dream. # Jess: So you're telling me the circus owner from my dream can really be some gentleman who lives in my neighbourhood? # Charlie: Exactly! You don't even remember his face, but after you saw it just once, your brain keeps it somewhere in storage. # Lynn: WOW, it sounds really cool!
{ Charles | Monica }  # Charles: How can you tell that someone has gluten intolerance? # Karen: You can have coeliac disease which makes it impossible for you to digest gluten or be allergic to gluten. From what I've heard, being allergic is far worse, because you have an allergic reaction that can be lethal, while being intolerant can make feel you some unpleasant symptoms, but I don't think may lead to your death # Jack: Why are you asking? Is there something wrong? # Charles: Hm, I don't know, I feel that I may be allergic or something # Monica: Do you have any symptoms? Check those articles: # Monica: <file_other>, <file_other> # Karen: I think that you may have a very very light allergy at best, otherwise you would have known - trust me # Karen: When it comes to intolerance... I know it's very hip to be gluten intolerant, but I don't believe that suddenly half of the population is gluten intolerant. Unless you have a coeliac disease, I think you're fine # Jack: My friend was told that she may be intolerant or allergic and she did a blood test - she's absolutely fine # Charles: I may do it as well. I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much # Karen: But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better # Monica: I did the same thing with lactose, I wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. I stopped eating it and I'm much better now # Jack: But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this? # Monica: It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens # Charles: I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare # Karen: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food? # Charles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet # Karen: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm # Monica: You should read the articles I sent you, check the symptoms and what you shouldn't eat # Charles: Thanks! I'm really worried, because it's getting worse and I have no idea what's happening with me
