{ Roseanne | Kyle | Vince | Megan }  # Kyle: Who wants to go out for a drink? # Megan: No, sorry, I'm cleaning the house today. # Roseanne: You've always loved cleaning, haven't you? I remember how angry you used to get with your brother for leaving a mess in the kitchen. # Vince: Yeah, she'd always yell at me, even though I was the one in charge when our parents were away. # Kyle: I don't get why it matters so much whether I clean my flat once a week or once a month. No one died from a bit of dust. # Megan: Remind me to never stay at your place :P # Roseanne: I'm somewhere in between. My house is always a mess, but I hate it when it's dirty. # Vince: What's the difference? # Roseanne: I can't stand when there's dust, crumbs on the floor etc., so I clean regularly. But I love it when all my stuff just lies around. When I put everything back on shelves or into cabinets, I keep on getting mad that I have to look for it, get up and take it out, and generally lose so much time. I like to have everything within my reach. # Vince: There's no better wardrobe than the armchair, right? XD # Kyle: I prefer the floor. There's more space on it :D # Megan: Just reading this gives me the creeps. # Kyle: Fine, go back to cleaning, we'll think of you while sharing a beer :D # Roseanne: Hey, I never said I can come. My hubby's away this weekend, so I have no one to leave the kids with ;( # Vince: Take them to Megan's place, they can help her clean :D # Megan: You know what? I don't care. I can watch your kids, Roseanne. Just bring them over. # Roseanne: But are you serious or just mad at us? # Megan: No, I'm serious. I like your kids. And they're nice enough that if I ask them to do something, they actually do it :D # Roseanne: LOL, okay. Actually, I think that when I tell them to go and help aunt Meg with cleaning, they'll think it's fun. # Vince: And when you tell them to clean their own rooms, they say you're a monster? :D # Roseanne: Exactly. But Bill for example always cleans the windows at my parents house. They don't even need to ask anymore, he simply knows it's his job. # Kyle: Do they pay him? :P # Roseanne: Well, sometimes. But still I think he likes doing it. I don't know, maybe it's because no one checks if he did it well, he's just left alone to do his thing, so he feels like a man in the house in a way? # Megan: Tell them I can pay with cookies if they help me. # Roseanne: The famous chocolate cookies? # Megan: Why not? I'm feeling generous today :D # Roseanne: Guys, I think I'm gonna change my mind about that beer. Meg, would you accept one more helper? :D # Megan: You're always welcome! But sorry boys, it's going to be a “girls only” event (except for little Billy). Otherwise my house will never get cleaned today :D

But there were no choice😰 # Stefy: keep hope, and think about next month # Stefy: sun, sea, and martini ....

{ Sandra | Olivia }  # Sandra: Hey, are you busy this Friday? # Olivia: hi, no, not really, why? :) # Sandra: Don't laugh at me, but one of my new year resolutions is to learn horse riding. # Olivia: Wow! Are you serious? # Sandra: What do you think? # Olivia: Hm, not sure. It sounds really cool, but isn't it dangerous? # Sandra: Well, it can be, yes, but I don't think it's much more dangerous than driving a car. # Sandra: Accidents happen everywhere. I get your point, I was thinking about it as well. # Olivia: And? Aren't you afraid? # Sandra: A bit, yes, but I always wanted to learn horse riding, so I thought that as soon as it isn't anything that requires me to, I don't know, go abroad or a lot of money, I may at least give it a try. # Olivia: Makes sense. I'm just worried ;) # Sandra: I know <3 Pity though as I wanted you to join me :>... # Olivia: Me?! # Sandra: I booked a slot on Friday afternoon after work. So far I booked only one, but I know there some slots left. # Sandra: Sooo... Do you want to join me? :) # Olivia: What time exactly? # Sandra: We should be there around 5.30, the lesson starts at 6. # Olivia: Hm... It does sound tempting, but I'm scared :D # Sandra: Come on, Ov. You know, it'd be so much more fun if we go together. # Olivia: I feel I'm going to regret it, but ok :P How much is it? # Sandra: 20 quid per hour, you spend there always more around two, but pay only for the riding part.

What time are you arriving in Madrid? # Christian: 21:20 at barajas airport # Isabel: Please let me know when you arrive.

It'll be sooo much more convenient now. Our place isn't really that easy to reach by public transport, there's only one bus and it's like the timetable doesn't exist so you often end up waiting at the stop for ages. # George: Oh man, I remember it used to be like this. I thought things might've changed since the times I used to take the bus to visit you, but I guess not? # Max: Yeah, sadly... but whatever. Now we won't have to rely on them any more, woohoo! # George: Must have been hard to convince Sylvia, no? # Max: She was against it at first but I knew she had to give in eventually. I mean, it'll benefit all of us, after all. # George: Man, you'll be so happy, I'm sure. I know I don't regret it. Nothing beats the comfort and freedom, really. # Max: Yeah, I'm trying to convince her to get a licence, too. I don't want her to feel like I'm only doing this for myself. It would be better if both of us could drive.

What's it bout? # Elle: Well basically in America when Congress meets, there's always one person who doesn't attend in case of a terrorist attack (they're the "designated survivor").

{ Oliver | Emily | Chris }  # Oliver: I think I should stop reading the rules after we already played a game # Oliver: found two things we were doing wrong today # Chris: maybe it shows that you should keep reading them # Chris: so what we were doing wrong? # Oliver: first the basic follow-up only gives you temp influence and not the permanent one (so my whole strategy for the day was basically based on a wrong rule :P) # Oliver: and second, you only get the income for the resources you own (tokens on top) and not for everything you have access to # Chris: the map had full symbol drawn for the action so I also thought it was permanent influence # Chris: had no idea about the second one # Emily: the second rule means money would be much more sparse # Oliver: well yes but it gives you a reason to build an already existing building again # Oliver: with the rules we played with there was no sense in doing that # Emily: true # Emily: yet another game we need to play again with the right rules ;) # Oliver: additionally during the vote phase, if there is a draw the first decision is taken by the player with the least amount of points and not the closest to the player initiating the vote # Chris: makes sense # Chris: but I'm not sure about the income phase, it's written that you get income for import # Olivier: well yes but technically the import action is building your own buildings # Oliver: so no matter how you look at it with import you'll always be on top with your token and get the income # Chris: right # Chris: well just like Emily said we need to play this again # Emily: we can always do it during the next meeting # Oliver: as usual I'm up for anything # Oliver: but if we'll play a new game, let me read the rules first :P

I hear not all cables are compatible for some reason but imo you should be able to find a cheaper replacement that should work... their prices are too high # Amanda: uhh... alright, I guess checking what's wrong comes first # Keith: can you do it now? # Amanda: yeah, I'll brb # Keith: k # Amanda: back # Amanda: and it's still not charging :( # Keith: then it must be the cable. or... # Amanda: or?? there's another possibility? # Keith: well, I guess there might be sth wrong with the charging port but that's the worst case scenario # Keith: so let's not think about it yet? # Amanda: I'm a bit worried now but ok :( # Keith: I've found some shop that sells replacement cables # Keith: <file_other> # Keith: I'd try this one first, see if the phone detects the cable at all # Keith: cuz if it does, then problem solved, if it doesn't... then it might be the port # Keith: but it's cheap enough to give it a try # Amanda: thanks, I'll do that... I hope it'll work, not sure if I can afford a repair :/

{ Sally | Fran }  # Fran: so how's the new affair going?;) # Sally: hmm # Fran: what happened? # Sally: I'm not sure. I mean everything is fine but there's no chemistry. Maybe there's something wrong with me # Fran: There's nothing wrong with you. Don't let yourself think that. Maybe you just need more time # Sally: It's not like I wanna give up but sometimes I wonder if I should be forcing myself # Fran: Definitely not. But maybe try not to put so much pressure on it # Sally: I just don't understand it. And myself # Fran: You don't have to understand anything :) # Sally: I mean there was definitely a spark at the beginning and now I really don't know what happened and how to get it back # Fran: You probably started thinking too much ;) # Sally: Hahah probably. My head is my worst enemy # Fran: You just met, don't force it. Why would you want chemistry that just dies out after 3 months? Maybe deep down you're looking for something more serious or stable and that's why you actually don't wanna rush it? And you're older now. It's more difficult to fall madly in love when you are not so easily fooled anymore ;) # Sally: I get it. It's not even about falling in love. I just don't get what happened. I mean I can't be in a relationship with absolutely no chemistry at all # Fran: Well it went away so maybe it will come back :D You can't overthink those things. They don't like it ;) # Sally: I probably am overthinking. We had a heart to heart and I feel much better after the talk # Fran: You want soulmates, intellectual connection, and chemistry - that's some high expectations for a new relation. Not everything at once # Sally: Yeah I would but I know I can't have it all # Fran: Of course you can. But some things work better overtime. On the other hand, do NOT force yourself into anything.  # Sally: I'm not going to. I guess I've been lucky I found someone who is understanding and wants to discuss things # Fran: Exactly.

I would like to ask if there have been any news about tomorrow's classes. Everyone is wondering whether they should come to the university tomorrow or not. Thank you in advance for any information. Kind regards, Alice # Margaret: Good evening, all classes will take place according to schedule tomorrow, so no good news for the students! :) By the way, I would really prefer if students wrote to me on my email address. # Alice: I know, I apologize # Margaret: Ok, just remember in the future. # Alice: It's just we got used to communicating with Dr. Smith via Facebook, he uses it all the time # Margaret: I know, Dr. Smith has a very informal approach, however I happen not to share his views. # Alice: Ok, sorry again, Professor! # Margaret: You know I only answered here because you are older than your fellow students, had it been one of the others I would have told the rascal to send me a proper email message. ;) # Alice: I know, I apologize once again # Margaret: No problem, see you tomorrow! # Alice: Have a nice evening # Margaret: You too. # Alice: Oh and may I ask you one more thing? # Margaret: I feel like I'm being forcibly Dr. Smith-ized here. # Alice: Sorry again... # Margaret: Ok, ok, just ask. # Alice: May I ask you if you have read the second chapter of my thesis?

{ Barry | Patricia }  # Patricia: Barry!! Have you heard the news? They released a demo gameplay from Cyberpunk 2077! # Barry: What, really? Where did you see that? # Patricia: <file_video> # Barry: Holy shit, that's pretty impressive... I was pumped for the game already but now THIS is hype. Whoa. # Patricia: I know, right! I loved Wild Hunt but this is like a completely different level? # Barry: It really is. I guess we'll see when the game gets released but for once the NPCs seemed like real people, even the crowds. They said they'd be working on that and now I'm sold. # Patricia: Yeah, they didn't move awkwardly or anything, it really felt like the world was alive. I can't wait!! # Barry: It's only a shame about the POV... # Patricia: You don't like first-person? # Barry: Well, I guess it's okay at times but I'd prefer over-the-shoulder. They say you can customise everything about your character so I'd kind of like to be able to see my gear because otherwise what's the point. # Patricia: Huh... I actually haven't played first-person much, but I ended up really enjoying it in Morrowind. It felt really immersive and when I switched to third-person view for a moment, it felt strange. # Barry: Well, I'll still be hoping for an option to switch to third-person... # Patricia: I wouldn't really count on that. They seem really committed to their vision and think this is the best choice so people can enjoy the world 100%. # Barry: I'm still not sure but y'know, not gonna hate until it's actually release. It looks really good so far so I'd be happy if they proved me wrong and made me enjoy the POV. # Patricia: I just wish they'd tell us the release date already! # Barry: Hmm, who knows... I think it was supposed to be ready this year, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

Are you having fun? # Matty: Sounds interesting I've gotta say. Particularly the bacteria stuff! I've been on a walk today so quite tired from that. And I'm enjoying uni yeah! Very very busy. Starting dissertation stuff soon and had a lot of work for essays # Ella: Did you take any photos whilst on your walk? :D So... what does your dissertation stuff look like? Are you in any Uni groups? # Matty: Got some yeah :) posted one to Facebook. Mine is looking like geography and politics related. Not sure about uni groups? What's your dissertation on if you have to do one? # Ella: We don't really have dissertations... at the end of my third year I'll be writing my degree, so that will be like a slightly longer lab report :) Geography and politics - hmmm... that's  a pretty wide topic, I mean, you could talk about Global warming etc. right? # Matty: Aah ok. So the long report is a big part of your degree and counts a lot towards it? # Matty: And it's very wide the topic. Can talk about that yes, can also do social and cultural stuff too in there # Ella: Yeah, basically my grades and my report make up my degree :) Social and cultural stuff... like what? # Matty: Aaah cool :D I have exams too which make mine up haha. Lucky you # Matty: And stuff like social separation and classes and how everything plays into each other and culture is like heritage and what matters to different people # Ella: I meant grades from exams, so I don't know if I'm really that lucky :P That's actually really interesting! So how do you prepare for this? Do you get to interview people? # Matty: Oh right haha. And I have to do loads of reading and prepare some fieldwork. And I likely will have to inerview people yeah. What kind of things do you do in the lab? # Ella: Depends on your field of study - I'm doing Embriology, so I basically conduct experiments on mouse oocytes that should hopefully give some decent results. But other people can grow bacteria on petri dishes if they're doing Microbiology, or study particular fragments of DNA if they're doing Genetics # Ella: It really depends on what you're studying - Biology has a pretty large spectrum, afterall :)

{ Michaela | Jessie | Steve | Ron }  # Michaela: So what do you guys think about the association idea? # Ron: I might be lacking the context here # Michaela: Basically we were thinking of turning the club into an official association, so it's easier to get funds for events for example # Jessie: I'm torn actually - I get why it would help with funds, cooperation with other institutions and such, but I researched it and it involves quite a bit of paperwork. # Steve: And someone to take care of it permanently, cause it doesn't end at setting up the association - you have to do it every year. # Michaela: These are exactly the kind of things that I wanted to discuss with you. Do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork? Doesn't have to be one person. # Steve: Frankly, I don't see anyone doing this - we all have jobs, barely have time for meetings sometimes and it's a ton of responsibility # Ron: The question is - do the profits of being an association surpass the costs - like the amount of time and work we put into it? There are also some financial costs, are there? # Michaela: yeah, like a small fee when you set it up, but nothing more really. # Jessie: so what do we get from it really? # Michaela: maybe the cost of a rubber stamp. # Michaela: for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year, but to apply you need to be a formal association <file_other> # Ron: and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us, because we weren't an association # Jessie: I think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually # Michaela: I recall two as well # Steve: but do we truly need those subsidies? We've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it - that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it, just with collective effort. # Steve: I'm just afraid we're gonna lose this sense of an informal get-together, it's all just gonna turn into a business and will create tensions between us. I've seen it happen to clubs like ours # Ron: it's not necessarily going to happen to us and we could make some better events with more funding # Michaela: association is not a business, we're not gonna start selling things. It's just about access to the possibilities that's we're denied right now cause we're not a formal association # Jessie: well... I could help out with the paperwork, but not alone. I'd say 2 more people would be enough to make this work # Michaela: as this was my idea, I can help too, just a matter of dividing our work properly # Ron: I can't take up additional responsibilities right now with all that's been going on, so I won't be able to help, buy if y'all agree it's a good idea, I'm going to support it # Michaela: Steve? # Steve: I don't know man, I like things the way they are right now # Michaela: Ok, maybe it's better to talk about this in person. Is Monday after the meeting ok for you all? # Steve: yup, I can stay a bit longer # Jessie: Fine by me # Ron: as well

Suppose he left the iron on the shirts and forgot to unplug it, but will never know.  # Lynn: Have you tried an ironing machine? # Jody: Yes, I have an iron at home. Don't need to borrow it from the neighbour. # Lynn: No, like this: <file_other> # Jody: What's this? # Lynn: An ironing machine. Useful with shirts, T-shirts and similar.  # Jody: So, how does it work? # Lynn: Not sure.

{ Ricardo }  # Jan: Guys... the landlord has just published her review of us. It's I-N-S-A-N-E <file_photo> # Emma: Give me a sec # Ricardo: FUCK # Emma: I especially like the bit about Janek being "sombre" and "exceptionally rude" # Jan: omg was I? # Emma: Hmmmm well, I bet it's one of these cultural differences... As a Spaniard she probably expected you to become her best friend and have a friendly chat about the weather... Instead, you greeted her enumerating all the faults of the apartment (which I would also do, but I understand if it was too much for her). # Jan: Well then, I'll write to her and apologise, perhaps she'll change the review? # Emma: I doubt it, but you can try if you have a moment to spare. Again, I don't really think you've done anything wrong, but upon some consideration, she might have misunderstood our non-Spanish behaviour # Jan: Yeah, I think you're right. Also, I assume this thing about cigarette fags all over the balcony is yet another delusion of hers? # Emma: Fuuuck. I actually might have left some... I was so tired in the morning I didn't even think about that. I'm so sorry guys 😭 # Jan: Well, it looks like we deserve the shitty review and there's not much we can do about it, can we? # Ricardo: Hmmm, yeah, you might be right. In any case it's only one negative review by a silly old woman, I don't really think it'll ruin our lives # Jan: I feel like it'll totally ruin mine 💩 # Emma: Change your name to Juan as I've been suggesting for years # Jan: 😂 # Ricardo: When life gives you lemons, change your name to Juan # Emma: And your life will be much fun lalalalaaaa 🎵 # Jan: AAAAAAAAAAAA 🙉🙉🙉

I've always wanted to go to Barcelona with a hot guy on my arm ;) # Wilson: Don't worry, I'll be your arm candy any time :P # Leah: Oh please - you'll be much more than that. I'm counting on you to be my personal masseuse and to carry my luggage. # Wilson: My girlfriend - the diva. # Leah: ;)
{ Luisa | Leu | Bill }  # Leu: How are you? Any new development about the house? # Luisa: Hello my dear!  Sadly not. No news at all regarding the house :(( We'll be sitting on it till the end of our lives! # Leu: That can't be. It is such a fantastic property. In such an incredibly beautiful estate. It's a matter of time. # Luisa: That's what we thought last spring when we put it on the market. # Leu: It took me 2 years to sell my flat back in Poland. # Luisa: Oh well... Wait and see. The last prospective buyers we had, 5 weeks back, were so enthusiastic we'd thought we're done. They said ours was shortlisted, their favourite in Ballito, but they still wanted to check another estate. And that was it. She didn't even bother to phone, just sent me a minimal message. Bill got so frustrated that he drank himself stiff that night. # Leu: He does it from time to time, doesn't he? # Luisa: From time to time? Regularly!!! Can't you remember?! # Leu: Not quite. Never saw him really tight. # Luisa: Cause you used to leave before his evening was over. I'm seriously worried about his health, to tell you the truth. It's just every day that he tipples. # Leu: As if slowly killing himself with liquor. # Luisa: He doesn't care. He says he's got his life behind him. # Leu: But it is terrible. How can you cope with it? # Luisa: I stopped to care too. It is his life. If he wants to put a quicker end to it, it's up to him. Look I cannot do anything about it. What hide bottles? Just don't want to have an invalid in my house one day. # Leu: Therapy? # Luisa: Gimme a break! Can you imagine Bill attending an AA therapy like a good boy! I can't. # Leu: Nor can I. # Luisa: We even stopped talking about his drinking problem long ago. When he started, just after and because of his early retirement, I thought I'd better refrain from commenting because he's so depressed. But then it was worse and worse... Now it's too late. # Leu: Poor Luisa, poor Bill. It is so sad. But you are tough Luisa. You are so incredibly tough and strong and even-tempered, I'd say. # Luisa: Yes, I am. That keeps me sane. I don't worry if I can't change it. To a degree... # Leu: Right you are! "The beach scape changes every month as tides bring in tons of sand and cover the rocks making the beach appear totally different." Do you remember? # Luisa: "Then the rocks are laid bare as the tide pulls away the sand. Such is life."

{ Max | Allen | Jeremy | Mark | Virginia | MJ }  # Max: Din anyone actually watch this the video?  # Max: <link_video> # Allen: Research shows that long term cannabis use ( via smoke inhalation ) produces NO noticeable long term consequences - whereas tobacco use leads to COPD ect. But cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath. But these subside when cannabis smoking ceases. # Jeremy: Wrong, it wasn't long term use, but rather an "occasional low cumulative", which could be something like smoking once or twice a month. # Max: Tom You didn’t watch the video. # Tom: I was just about to complain, then i saw your post. Thanks. ;) # Jason: I like how he doesn't mention the fact that most people smoking spliffs will probably be using tobacco in them as well pretty much everybody I know who smokes weed put tobacco in them and they smoke cigarettes as well. # Daniel: Short attention span 😊 # Max: Daniel probably from pot 🤷‍♂️ # Max: Jason he does - rewatch the end man. He doesn’t specifically say combing the two , but he says one usually precedes the other.  # David: Jason, I used to smoke baccy avec hashish but no longer, and I know only one person out of billions who still smokes weed with tobacco. # Rawiri: Jason Hollis yuck...why even??? # Tom: I know that a joint is bigger than a roach, so is a spliff bigger than a joint? # David: I don’t believe there is a size relationship between names of roll-ups (except for the roach which is a mostly smoked roll-up). I say that the names began as code words for an illegal item at that time. Some spliffs may be big some joints be small... # Ken: Allen So quit smoking it and no inflammation which we all know that inflammation is the number one cause of all other health issues. # Tom: BTW Seeing it's still illegal at a federal level, I'd like to know where such studies were conducted legally. Propaganda. Keep gobbling those opiate based pills, they're fine # Brian: this is only stating the harms of smoking cannabis. It's not saying cannabis is harmful... there are other ways to use it without turning to opiates. # Ken: Really? Putting smoke in your lungs is bad for your respiratory system.....shocker. oil....edibles...many ways to enjoy and get relief from chronic pain and or what ever you need to get on with it. # Mark: Cannabis does not have a bad affect on the lungs!! # Virginia: MJ users will not believe anything bad. They think it is right up there with kale and swiss chard!

Where is she? # Doris: Pietermaritzburg # Jill: How long do you have to drive there? # Doris: 1.5 hours off peak traffic. # Jill: Not so bad. Will you be driving to see her soon? # Doris: Dunno yet.

{ Ashley | Gerardo }  # Ashley: This one is mostly for the ladies (but certainly open to the men of the tribe, too!!).....Some of us had talked about an eyebrow skillshare and since I plan to reshape and dye/tint my eyebrows in the next few days, it seems like the perfect time to get moving on this. We can discuss eyebrow/face geometry, brow mapping, how to tint/dye them (should you wish to, I have brown and black dye with me and I welcome you to use it), and how to fill them in with makeup.  Let me know if you would like to join! # Gerardo: Yall can clean my eyebrows if u need a pair to practice on # Ashley: If you are curious how my passion for eyebrows began, it was because I was formerly the program manager overseeing the implementation of a program designed to help individuals going through cancer regain self-confidence through beauty techniques - with a heavy emphasis on drawing on new eyebrows. <file_link> # Anna: <file_gif> # Ashley: Gery, fully expect you to attend this skillshare now that you have offered yourself up. # Gerardo: A man is nothing without his word. U can count on it.
